# Predict-Numeric-Values
# Description
Welcome to my project, predicting numerical values. The project is written using the python framework. The idea around this project is for continuous learning and looking for more ways of building machine learning models. The project started with beginners to advanced methods of using Numpy and Pandas libraries; they demonstrated different visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Also, the project contains regression models that predict different numerical datasets
